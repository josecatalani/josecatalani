### Hello 👋

My name is José. I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer from São Paulo, working at [Grover](https://www.grover.com).

Now, I'm currently responsible to take _with so much_ care our SEO Growth department, and I'm loving it! 😀. Using React, Node, typescript, AWS services (cloudfront + r53 + s3 and much more) and trying to be proficient as possible. You can reach me to talk more about my position, let's go!

### 🌱. I’m currently learning:
* Python and Ruby: Both are incredible languages, well documented with so much opportunities to create, I'll give a try 👍
* Data Structures: It is always important to keep learning and practicing data structures, to a better readability in your code
* Machine Learning: I engaged into a MBA in Data Science, it's been so much fun to learn all those things. It's been challenging thoug but I'm making progress.

### 💬. Ask me about ... 
anything, I'm here.
